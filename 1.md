ACE2 ectodomain (Haga et al., 2008; Jia et al., 2009). This results in non-functional pulmonary ACE2 receptor which has been advised to be linked with acute lung injury (Imai et al., 2008; Kuba et al., 2006); decreased activity of ACE2 further triggered renin-angiotensin system (RAS) dysfunction and caused enhance inflammation, and vascular permeability (Gheblawi et al., 2020). In animal studies with murine acute respiratory distress (ARD) model showed association of reduced ACE2 function with an increased lung edema, neutrophil accumulation, enhanced vascular permeability, and diminished lung function (Imai et al., 2005). Also, in human airway epithelia, constitutive shedding of ACE2 receptor by activity of a metalloprotease 17 (ADAM17), also called as tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) converting enzyme (TACE), and disintegrin secrete functionally active soluble ACE2 (sACE2) (Lambert et al., 2005). HCoVs infection and inflammatory cytokines like interleukin 1 beta (IL-1β) and TNF-α were related with enhance ACE2 shedding (Haga et al., 2008; Jia et al., 2009). Notably, in vitro studies presented close association of SARS-CoV S protein-induced ACE2 shedding with TNF-α production (Haga et al., 2008). Although, biological function of sACE2 is yet unknown, however, recent studies have suggested direct involvement of sACE2 in inflammatory responses against SARS-CoV, and possibly also connected with SARS-CoV-2 (Fu et al., 2020). Additionally, apoptosis of type 2 alveolar cells caused release of specific inflammatory mediators which further instigate macrophages to secrete three essential immune substances; interleukin- 1 (IL-1), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and TNF-α; also called as cytokines. These immune substances in the bloodstream produced infection symptoms linked to HCoVs (Huang et al., 2020).
