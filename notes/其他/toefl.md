While the author of the reading passage expresses concern for the declining number of birds throughout the world, the professor in convinced that birds are in no danger at all in that their number are actually rising/ on the rise.

According to the reading, because the earth's population is increasing, so is the size of its cites, and there are less green area but pollution, which is causing birds to decrease in number.

- Does advertising manipulating consumer to buy things or is it actually an important source of information.

- Ads inform consumer of the features or properties of products.


Advertising has become so commonplace/ pervasive that there are concerns about the negative impacts is has brought to the general public. **From my perspective,/ my personal belief is that** advertising not only provides us with a rich alternatives to chose from but it also boost the economy. 

Advertisements on magazines, TV, and radio inform consumers of the latest products and service whose properties are emphasized in ads. After exposed to such commercials or print ads, people can make their own choice whether to make a purchase or not as they know the ==qualitative differences== themselves. 

I understand Daisy's concern over the value of advertising, but I believe she misses another critical points. Advertisement also provide job of opportunities in advertising-related industry such as media or show businesses, and trigger/ facilitate products innovation bringing about better life to people/ better standards of life. With such positive competitions among the manufacturers and service provides, consumer are able to enjoy the top notch technological products or wholesome service.


### why do companies emphasize that their products are new 
Advertisers use the appeal of novelty in order to compete in the marketplace, and because they understand consumer psychology. In simple terms, companies produce and sell new products ==in an attempt to== set themselves apart from their competitors. When, for example, Apple created the first iPhone, their advertisements emphasized the keyless glass screen because on other phone on the market had this feature. New products and features are sold with the promise that they will save time, improve their user experience,increase the owner's status, or enhance the consumer;s quality of life in some way.

Advertiser have learnt that such promises are incredibly/ remarkably effective sales tools because they **tap into human's deepest desires.**
