### article

While the author of the reading passage expresses concern for the declining number of birds throughout the world, the professor in convinced that birds are in no danger at all in that their number are actually rising/ on the rise.

According to the reading, because the earth's population is increasing, so is the size of its cites, and there are less green area but pollution, which is causing birds to decrease in number. On the contrary, the professor says that the green zones still exist and that birds are learning to adapt to city life like pigeons in New York city.

Next, the reading than assert that much forested land is being cleared for agricultural practices to feed Earth's population, and these activity is endangered many birds. However, the professor claim that Earth still have many forested area and that agricultural method have advanced so much that less land is needed to parm up.

Finally, the author of the reading states insecticide and chemicals like DDT are being used all around the world, and they are killing many birds. the lecturer concedes that insecticide are being used less and less nowadays. she also add that in tha case of DDT, it is only use to kill malaria-carrying mosquitos these days.

- Does advertising manipulating consumer to buy things or is it actually an important source of information.
- products and services are touted/ promoted in the way that entices consumers to make purchase.
- most people don't find ads valuable now.
- Ads inform consumer of the features or properties of products.


Advertising has become so commonplace/ pervasive that there are concerns about the negative impacts is has brought to the general public. **From my perspective,/ my personal belief is that** advertising not only provides us with a rich alternatives to chose from but it also boost the economy. 

Advertisements on magazines, TV, and radio inform consumers of the latest products and service whose properties are emphasized in ads. After exposed to such commercials or print ads, people can make their own choice whether to make a purchase or not as they know the ==qualitative differences== themselves. 

I understand Daisy's concern over the value of advertising, but I believe she misses another critical points. Advertisement also provide job of opportunities in advertising-related industry such as media or show businesses, and trigger/ facilitate products innovation bringing about better life to people/ better standards of life. With such positive competitions among the manufacturers and service provides, consumer are able to enjoy the top notch technological products or wholesome service.


### why do companies emphasize that their products are new 
Advertisers use the appeal of novelty in order to compete in the marketplace, and because they understand consumer psychology. In simple terms, companies produce and sell new products ==in an attempt to== set themselves apart from their competitors. When, for example, Apple created the first iPhone, their advertisements emphasized the keyless glass screen because on other phone on the market had this feature. New products and features are sold with the promise that they will save time, improve their user experience,increase the owner's status, or enhance the consumer;s quality of life in some way.

Advertiser have learnt that such promises are incredibly/ remarkably effective sales tools because they **tap into human's deepest desires.**

## advantages and disadvantage

### big company 
- more stable 
  - established companies typically offer more job stability, consistent pay, and comprehensive benefits package, which can be reassuring gor recent graduates.
- more bureaucratic
  - Large companies can be bureaucratic, with more layers of management and slower decision-making process, which may ==limit autonomy and  impact==
- Rich resources
  - receive structured training
  - professional development
  - have access to industry experts -- all these can facilitate young graduate;s professional development
- better networking 
  - With extensive industry networks, big company
- Narrow/ limited specialization
  - Young graduates may be assigned to a specific role with limited exposure to different aspects of the business, potentially leading to narrow skill set.


## asset 
Even through there are risk like job instability and longer working hour, I still believe that if these start-ups are highly potential and promising, they will be (of great benefits to)/ (tremendously/ significantly beneficial to ) new college graduates. 
First, start-up are often ==at the forefront of innovation== and can offer young graduates the chance to work on cutting-edge projects and technologies. It is this dynamic working environment that makes the contribution of employees have a more ==profound impact on the company's success== and allow young workers to shape its direction and culture. [I understand Mirabel's concern over the good resume for young graduates, but I believe that she misses a critical point.] In fact, another career benefit brought about by this choice is that start-ups always provide a workplace where workers can ==wear multiple hats== and gain exposure to various aspects of the business, ==facilitating/ promoting/ fostering rapid learning and personal growth.==


---

For example, such company tends to have smaller teams and less ==hierarchy== and each member has to shoulder several responsibilities ==ranging from== contacting ==prospective customers==, helping them with problem shootings. All these experience may not be obtained in the first few years of established companies, but start-ups may help them achieve so.


## being happy with job is more important than having a high salary

Most people love having jobs where can we earn a lot of money. Unfortunately, they do not always enjoying doing  these jobs. To me, ==it seems to apparent that== being better with one's job is much more important than having a high-paying job. In fact, being ==satisfied== with a job makes it more meaningful than any amount of money can ever make. For example, ==renown humanitarians an non-governmental organizations== ==strike to make this world a better place== with their ==monetary== contributions, yet they enjoy in engaging in charity work because they truly find these job meaningful. Even though ==they are almost unpaid for doing so==, these benefactors are simply satisfied with their accomplishments of helping the pool or meek.
Without grand passion for these unpaid jobs, they may easily discouraged/==daunted== in the face of difficulty.

## notes 

- Humans were to blame for the dodo's extinction.
- Humans were supposed to be ==held accountable== for dodo's extinction



## Asset 

While the author of the reading passage attributes/ascribes the disappearance of dodo to human activity, the professor believes that humans were not the reason why dodo disappear.

The reading states that humans were responsible for the dodo's extinction. The lecture, however, disagrees and casts doubts on the explanation made in the reading.

The first point reading mentions is that the flightless dodo was not afraid on humans, so they could easily hunt it and many domesticated animal brought bt the Dutch ==prey upon dodos and their eggs.== On the contrary, the professor asserts that the Dutch did not hunt the dodo in that they ==despited== the tastes of its meat and called them disgusting bird.

The next point brought by the reading is that the Dutch destroyed the dodos' natural habitats. However, the professor first claim that deforestation did not cover the entire island nor did it kill other bird species. He then declare that dodo did not nest in trees, so their disappearance should not have bothered/ threatened/ endangered the dodo.

Finally, in contrast to reading's argument that disease brought by the Dutch might have killed the dodo. The professor says that the population of dodo may already have been declining. He than blame the extinction of dodo on massive cyclones that destroyed their nests and eggs.

All in all, although the reading passage brings up several reasons to blame humans for the dodo's extinction, the professor provides refutations and his own theory about the dodo's extinction.

## vocabulary

## sentence
Iron industry is prior to steam engine 

## Asset 

The reading passage's author believes that there were several reasons why the rise of factories occurred in the England, yet the professor in the lecture disagree that these were the main reasons why factory became that successful.

The first reason the reading ascribes to the rise of factories is the steam engine. Since steam engine could do the work of several man, they had to be placed in central locations, which lead to the raise of factories. Meanwhile, the professor believes it was not the steam engine but the iron and steal used to make the engines that were the real important factor, especially since they could also make railways, ships, factories.

While the reading passage's author believes the invention of railroads and steamship enabled raw materials and finish products to be transport rapidly worldwide, the professor point out that the railroads were invented decades after factory and sailing ships were still be used in twentieth century.

Finally, the reading notes that property right landless people to work in factories, and enable landowners further to develope factory. However, the professor claims that it was really the standardized production of weapons for which factories are first built and used, that lead to the rise of factories.

The reading passage's author and professor clearly disagree on the reason why the raise of the factory occurred.


# 8/16

## vocabulary

- assess/ evaluate 

## Asset 
When it comes to the right approach to teaching evaluation, I believe that student feedback is the most convincing information as they ==speak volume of== effective teaching upon students. In a traditional class setting, teachers always require to ==impart== their knowledge to student  in the sense that is comprehensive and ==enticing==/engaging/educational. These educator should adjust their ==pedagogical approaches/teaching methods== to ==cater the needs== of students from various learning background. Tor example, they should know how to transform a complex historical event to a real-life event that student can easily comprehend and absorb because an experienced history teacher ==knowing the essence of== the past events is capable of reflecting/mirroring this lesson to any ==relevant/pertinent present-day international affairs.== I understand Lincoln's and Reagan's concerns over teaching evaluation, but I believe teaching that are merely base on the test results or ==guidance== from senior teachers can lead to ==rigidity and repetition== in teaching method.


Students' perspective should also be consider in teacher evaluation since they can provide valuable insight to teaching effectiveness, classroom dynamic, and learning environment.

Relying solely on students' score is not advisable. Evan through test score can roughly inform teacher of student's learning.



## Some people say that the internat provides people with a lot of valuable information. Other think access to so much information creates problems

### postive 

From my opinion, the Internet is one of the most convenient tools with which you can easily find valuable information.
It is the truth that the Internet has revolutionized the way we obtain information while some critics blame these massive amount of information for causing negative impact on users, I personally consider the ==proliferation== of Internet information is rather beneficial to the general public.

- Acquire updated information immediately.
- Most of the information is ==free of charge==. --ensure equality in society
- Allow user to obtain feedback from all over the world.
- promote global unity
### Negative 

I tend to have the notion that excessive amounts of the information on the Internet can cause problems as many people cannot ==discern the authenticity== of Internet information they read online, they ==have the tendency to== be misled by an error judgement. It is undeniable that digital media has ==a powerful effect on our perception== and it creates a filter bubble that shapes the information we consume. This affect our ability to understand the perspectives of other people. In the case of deep fakes as much of the information on the Internet is misleading or just wrong, the authenticity of some news may sometimes be unbeknown to the readers. With so much rampant information websites, it could be difficult for Internet surfers to find accurate and quality information.

Innocent Internet shoppers may ==fall victims to online scams== as ==con artist== increasingly use the Internat to commit crimes such as catfishing, identity theft, or even cred ==card fraud.==

Internet users should be wary of / be aware of/ be ==vigilant== of/ be cautious of online information which may be harmful to children, adolescents, and adults alike.
