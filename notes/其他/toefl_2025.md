I strongly agree with Lena's opinion that medical advancements are the most significant invention of the past two centuries. Among them, the discovery of antibiotic, especially penicillin, has been truly revolutionary. When it was first used durning World War I, it greatly reduced the death rate among soldiers by preventing deadly infections of bacteria. Since then, antibiotics have saved millions of lives and become essential in modern healthcare. Without them, even minor injures or surgeries could lead to life-threating conditions. Therefore, I believe antibiotics represent one of the most important breakthroughs in human history, greatly improving both life expectancy and quality of life.

1. not the original use, constuct previous note buries but not same conclusion 
2. blue stone not native important but unclear ancient music healing scattle maybe second for buries
3. the number not enough many have been corrupted by thefts


The reading claims that Stonehenge in England was built as a burial site and provides three **pieces of evidence**. However, the lecture holds a different view and challenge each of the points made in the passage.

First, the reading states that the discovery of many human remains supports that Stonehenge was a burial site. The lecture disagrees with this point. He argues that the remains only prove that ritual burial was present in the Stonehenge, however the original propose of Stonehenge is still concealed. Moreover, previous researches didn't came to the same conclusion, although they considered the evidence of human remains. 

Secondly, the reading cites that the bluestones once stood in the Stonehenge are related to the burial **during a similar period**, however the lecture disputes this. Since these bluestones originate form a distant place, they must have a crucial purpose such as music or magical healing ceremony and the remains may be someone who died in the healing process.

Finally, the article raises a point that the artifacts unearthed at Stonehenge may indicate that Stonehenge might be the burial place for leaders. However, the lecture argues that although some artifacts such as stone maces might belong to high-ranking persons, the number of artifacts discovered there is too small to support such a conclusion. In addition, since the place has been subject many excavations and thefts, it is difficult to determine the identity of remains found there.

The reading passage claims that robots are more suitable than humans for space exploration and provides three reasons. However, the lecturer holds a different view.

First, the reading mentioned that robots are more productive because they don't get tired. The lecturer disagrees with this point. According to an expert's description, robots are not faster than humans because robots need the direction from the control room even when doing some simple tasks that humans can finish within a minute. Moreover, the company still needs engineers to repair and maintain the robots. 

Second, the article states that they can survive in extreme environments and don't need to eat food, but the lecturer disputes this, arguing that although the robots won't get injured, they can still break down and also require power supplies. Moreover, they may malfunction in extreme heat or cold conditions. 

Finally, the reading passage describes that robots excel at repetitive tasks. While the professor agrees this point, he argues that robots can't deal with complex missions like humans. Once a mistake occurs, them can only repeat it again and again. In addition, they don't have creativity.

I agree with that students should be encourage to participate extracurricular activities even if they might affect their academic performance. 
First, according to my experience, while extracurricular activities might affect students' performance, the affect will not be too sever and sometime the benefit is more than drawbacks. For example, some of my classmates participate in basketball team and they states that doing exercising is an useful relaxing when the they are overwhelmed by final exam. In the contrast, If they just spend all their time on study, they can't keep focus for that long.

The reading passage discusses three hypotheses on lunar formation; however, the lecture expresses doubt about each hypothesis. 

First, the reading claims that the Moon separated from the Earth because of the rapid spin of earth. The lecture disagrees with this point, arguing that according to the simulation, such a high rotational speed could have destroyed the whole planet. Moreover, the theory can't explain the evidence from moon rocks, which shows that the Moon was once hotter than the Earth.  

Second, the reading states that the Moon was formed at the same time from the same nebula as the Earth. The lecture argues that the chemical composition is different between the Earth and the Moon. For example, the proportion of Iron core in the Moon is less than the Earth. 

Finally, the reading raises a hypothesis that there was an indirect collision between the Earth and a planetary body, causing debris to formed the Moon. The lecture disputes this and questions why such a collision only produced one moon formed from the collision. In addition, the collision must lead to extremely high temperature but why the biochemical substances on the Moon were not evaporated.

The article claims the Vinland map is the oldest map that contains the exploration of American; However, the lecture disputes this.

First, the reading states that the map describes the regions where European has arrived in eleventh century. However, the lecture points out that the spelling style on the map is doubtable because it is not vinland style.

Second, the reading cites that according to the radiocarbon dating of the map paper, the Vinland map can date back to fiftieth century which fits the same time as Columbus in the New World. The lecture disputes this, arguing that the radiocarbon dating only related to the age when the paper made but not the map finished. 

Finally, the reading raises the evidence of ink used on the map, which contain Titanium like other maps during the same age. However, the lecture disagrees with this, he states that the Titanium ink is not only used in the fiftieth century but also in the twentieth century. Therefor, Titanium ink still can't be the deciding evidence to proof the authatisty Vinland map.

The article claims the Vinland map is the oldest map that contains the exploration of America; However, the lecture disputes this.

First, the reading states that the map describes the regions where Europeans had arrived in the eleventh century. However, the lecture points out that the spelling style on the map is doubtful. Compare to other maps attributed to the same period, the Vinland map use  capital letters more frequently and the spellings of some place names is Latin style but not  the Vinland style.

Second, the reading cites that according to the radiocarbon dating of the map paper, the Vinland map dates back to the fiftieth century. The lecture disputes this, arguing that the radiocarbon dating is only related to the age when the paper was made, but not the map was drawn. The lecturer explain that forgeries often use materials form correct period to make the fake appear authentic.

Finally, the reading presents evidence about the ink used on the map, which contains titanium, similar to other maps from the same period. However, the lecturer disagrees and states that ink containing titanium only began to be used in the twentieth century. Therefore, titanium ink cannot be the deciding evidence to prove the authenticity of the Vinland map.

How Gender Roles Have Shaped Social Expectations:
Traditional Roles Defined Responsibilities
Men were expected to be providers; women were expected to manage the home and raise children.
These roles influenced education, career choices, and social behavior.
Impact on Career Opportunities
Women faced limitations in professional fields and leadership roles.
Men were often discouraged from entering caregiving or emotional support roles.
Shaping Family Structures
Created the expectation of male-led households and female domestic roles.
Influenced marriage dynamics and parenting styles.
Cultural and Media Reinforcement
Movies, advertising, and education reinforced traditional gender norms for decades.

What We Can Learn to Promote Gender Equality:
Challenge Stereotypes
Encourage individuals to pursue interests and careers regardless of gender norms.
Promote Shared Responsibilities
Normalize equal roles in parenting, caregiving, and household duties.
Support Inclusive Workplaces
Ensure equal opportunities, fair pay, and leadership access for all genders.
Educate from an Early Age
Teach children that abilities and roles are not defined by gender.
Encourage Open Dialogue
Discuss gender expectations to raise awareness and reduce bias.

>How have generational differences shaped society and the workplace, and what can we learn to improve intergenerational interactions today?

The generational differences have shaped both the society and the workplace. For example, in my country, the older generation has experience an economic boom and their live quality significantly improved. Therefore, they naturally believe that hard work lead to success. However, the young generation is grow up in a society with slow economic growth and their are less opportunities but high living expenses. Young people are difficult to accumulate wealth no matter how hard they work. 

In my opinion, to improve intergenerational interaction, we should increase dialogue. Thus, the old generation can realize the dramatic change of the society and the dilemma young people meet. On the other hand, young people should know the sacrifices and values of previous generations that build the foundation of the society. By doing so, we can bridge the gap between generations and cooperate better in the workplace.

The reading passage discusses three theories about the formation of the moon, but the lecture casts doubt on each of them. 
First, the reading suggests that the Moon broke away from the earth due to the planet's rapid rotation. However, the lecturer challenges this idea, pointing out that simulation indicates such extreme spin would have cause the Earth to disintegrate. Furthermore, the theory still can´t explain the geological evidence from the moon rock, which shows that the Moon was much hotter than earth.

Second, the reading proposes that the Moon and the Earth formed simultaneously from the same region of nebula. The lecture; however, disputes this hypothesis by highlighting key differences in their chemical compositions. In particular, the Moon has a smaller iron core compared to the Earth. 

Finally, the reading passage presents a theory that the collision between the Earth and other planetary body produced debris that eventually formed the Moon. The lecture refutes this explanation as well, questioning why such a collision result in only one moon. Additionally, given the intense heat by such an impact, it is unclear why organic and biochemical substances on the Moon were not completely evaporated.
