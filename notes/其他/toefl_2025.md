I strongly agree with Lena's opinion that medical advancements are the most significant invention of the past two centuries. Among them, the discovery of antibiotic, especially penicillin, has been truly revolutionary. When it was first used durning World War I, it greatly reduced the death rate among soldiers by preventing deadly infections of bacteria. Since then, antibiotics have saved millions of lives and become essential in modern healthcare. Without them, even minor injures or surgeries could lead to life-threating conditions. Therefore, I believe antibiotics represent one of the most important breakthroughs in human history, greatly improving both life expectancy and quality of life.
